                    <p>"The black revolution is much more than a struggle for the rights of Negroes. It is forcing America to face all its interrelated flawsâ€”racism, poverty, militarism, and materialism. It is exposing evils that are rooted deeply in the whole structure of our society. It reveals systemic rather than superficial flaws and suggests that radical reconstruction of society itself is the real issue to be faced."</p>
